   - Solution: Implemented proper JWT storage and refresh mechanism

2. **Google OAuth Integration**
   - Challenge: Callback URL configuration issues
   - Fix: Properly configured environment variables and added clear error handling
   - Added proper state management for OAuth flow

## Phase 2: Notes Management 
### Core Notes Functionality
- Implemented CRUD operations for notes
- Added tags system and color customization
- Created responsive dashboard layout

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added smooth transitions using Framer Motion
- Implemented dark mode support
- Created loading states and error handling
- Added toast notifications for user feedback

### Notable Fixes
1. **Note Creation Bug**
   - Issue: Notes weren't showing up immediately after creation
   - Solution: Implemented optimistic updates in the UI

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**

- Implemented API endpoint testing
- Added error boundary testing

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive API documentation
- Created user guides
- Documented setup process

## API Endpoints Documentation
